# OpenRaven
Robotic Assistant for Versatile Everyday Needs

Raven is an open-source home assistant robot with a 5-DOF robotic arm and a differential drive base. It's currently teleoperated, with plans to add full autonomy soon.

> ðŸš§ This project is in early stages. The arm is functional via LeRobot, and the base runs on simple firmware + a ROS 2 node. Autonomy stack (SLAM, Nav2, perception) coming soon.
